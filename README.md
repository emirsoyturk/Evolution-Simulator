## Getting Started

This is a simple evolution simulator. It is a work in progress, and is not yet complete. It is written in Javascript, and uses the p5.js library.<br/>
Demo: [https://evolution-sim.netlify.com/](https://evolution-sim.netlify.app)

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Volthai7us/Evolution-Simulator/
   ```
2. Move to project folder
   ```sh
   cd Evoluation-Simulator
   ```

## How it works

- ### General
  - Click play to start the simulation.
  - Click pause to pause the simulation.
  - Click next to run the simulation for one generation.
  - Click reset to reset the simulation.
- ### Default Settings
  - The simulation starts with a population of 1000 creatures.
  - Each creature has a brain, which is a neural network.
  - The brain has 6 inputs, and 5 outputs. (These can be changed in the code)
  - The inputs are the location of the creature, left block, right block, top block, and bottom block.
  - The outputs are the direction the creature should move, left, right, up, down, or die.
  - The brain is initialized with random weights and biases.
- ### Canvas
  - The canvas splits 3 parts.
  - The top right part is the simulation.
  - The top left part is the creature's brain.
  - The bottom part is the chart of the population over time.
  - The orange area in chart is how many creatures are died in the generation.
  - The blue area in chart is how many creatures produced a child.
  - The gray area in chart is how many creatures did not produce a child.
- ### Extra Controls
  - Click a creature to see its brain.
  - Select fitness function from the dropdown menu.
  - Click the "Add Wall" button to add a wall to the simulation.
  - The "Safe Zone" slider controls the size of the safe zone.
  - The "Brain Size" slider controls the size of the brain.
  - The "Gene Number" slider controls the number of genes.
  - The "Threshold" slider controls the decision threshold.
